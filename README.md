# KisanBazaar 🌾  
### Direct Farmer to Consumer Platform

**Domain:** Open Innovation (AgriTech & Social Impact)

KisanBazaar is a web-based platform developed during a hackathon to connect farmers directly with consumers, reducing dependency on middlemen and ensuring fair and transparent agricultural trade.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Indian farmers often rely on middlemen due to the lack of direct digital access to consumers. This results in lower earnings for farmers and higher prices for consumers. Additionally, limited awareness of Minimum Support Price (MSP) and government agricultural schemes affects farmers’ income security and decision-making.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
KisanBazaar acts as a digital bridge between farmers and consumers. Farmers can list their produce, while consumers can browse available crops, compare prices with MSP, and place orders transparently. The platform also provides information about government agricultural schemes to improve awareness and trust.

## ✨ Key Features (MVP)
- Farmer login and crop listing  
- Consumer marketplace with order demo  
- MSP price comparison for selected crops  
- Government agricultural schemes information
